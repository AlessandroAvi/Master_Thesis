# CODE EXPLAINED

This repo contains the code that I developed for my master thesis.



### MAIN CODE

The main code where the training and the algorithms are defines is in the file "TinyOL.ipynb". Which is a notebook that I used in the Jupyter IDE.
I used a notebook because it was easier for me to debug and perform small changes understandiwng where the mistakes are.



### SEND LETTER TO UART

The file "sendLetterUART.py" is a python code that contains the script that I wrote for sending lots of data to the STM board in a fast way. In order to use it just plug in the STM, start the Python code and then press the BLUE BUTTON when shown on the screen in order to start the sending and automatic prediction performed by the STM.



### OTHER

All the other python files just contain the functions that I use in the Notebook file. I put those functions in new files because the notebook was getting quite difficult to scroll.
