# CONTENT OF  THIS DIRECTORY



These files are the logged txt file obtained from the MobaXTerm terminal during the communication with the STM.

The file called 'raw_vowels.txt' is a file that that contains 60 vowels in groups of 5.

All the other txt files contain one dataset from one single letter separated from each other (the different files are 
just because I recorded them in different days). Also having separated files between recording sessions and letters
allows me to remove data if it is 'bad' data.


The other files contains the following amount of samples:

letter_x_1 -> 40 samples
letter_x_2 -> 80 samples
letter_x_3 -> 50 samples

The files that are named 'letter_x_0' are just the separated version of the file 'raw_vowels'. These files are generated
in the script `run_parseataset.py`
