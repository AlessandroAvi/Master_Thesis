# README
 This repo contains the projects developed for the STM mcu. Each folder contains a different project:

- `Letter_dataset` : this folder contains all the accelerometer data that has been logged wwith the STM 
- `Log_data` : this folder contains the project that is used for recosrding the accelerometer data
- `TinyOL` : this folder contains the main project, where the entire OL system is developed and works for eprforming the ON LINE learning
- `TinyOL_acc` : this folder contains the same project as the one above, but in this case the data obtained for the inference doesn't coke from the UART port, but from the accelerometer
